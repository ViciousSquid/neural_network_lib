"""
Connection module for neural networks.

This module defines the Connection class, which represents a weighted
link between two neurons in the network.

class Connection:
    """
    Represents a weighted connection between two neurons.
    
    Connections are directional links between neurons that determine
    how activation flows through the network. Each connection has a
    weight that can be positive (excitatory) or negative (inhibitory).
    
    Attributes:
        source (str): Source neuron name
        target (str): Target neuron name
        weight (float): Connection weight (-1.0 to 1.0)
        last_update (float): Timestamp of last weight update
        creation_time (float): Timestamp of connection creation
        weight_history (list): History of weight changes with timestamps
        bidirectional (bool): Whether this is part of a bidirectional connection
